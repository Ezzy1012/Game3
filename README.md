Good day to whom it may concern, I trust that the following detailed essay may help to navigate yourself around both the app that I have developed as well as the app “GitHub’ and the actions that you can use in GitHub. So without any delay let's get started.
The Tamagotchi app:
For starters I do apologize that the app does not run, the reason is that the emulator on my laptop does not run as opposed to the emulator on the computer I use in computer room 4.
The front page of the app offers a warm welcome from the pet within the app as well as a button on the bottom which once pressed will take you to the main page/second page which will provide you with three buttons that have the words: Play; Feed; Clean.
Next to those three buttons will be three health bars that will work per the buttons opposite them. From that, once the user clicks on one of the buttons it will take the user to a new page that corresponds to the button pushed. 
For example: When the button “Play”, is clicked, the user will be taken to a new page where the pet is doing an action such as playing with a basketball. From there, the user will be able to click the back button which will take the user back to the main page where the health bar will be updated per how much time the pet has spent playing with its owner. However, if the user chooses to ignore the health bar decreasing then the pet’s image will be depicted as something according to the three options. 
For example:  When the health bar for the clean button starts to get lower and lower, the image of the pet will change from its current image to a duck in the shower.
That is just how the app that I have developed will work.

Exploring GitHub: A Direct to Collaboration and Form Control
GitHub has revolutionized the way computer program advancement is done, giving a stage for collaboration, adaptation control, and venture administration. It serves as a central center for designers to store, share, and contribute to ventures of all sizes. In this paper, we'll investigate what GitHub is, how to utilize it viably, and how to explore its different highlights.

Understanding GitHub
GitHub could be a web-based stage built around Git, a conveyed adaptation control framework. Git permits engineers to track changes to their code, collaborate with others, and return to past adaptations on the off chance that is required. GitHub upgrades Git's capabilities by including highlights such as issue tracking, drag demands, and venture management tools.

Getting Begun
To start utilizing GitHub, you to begin with got to make an account. Once logged in, you'll be able to make unused stores to store your code or contribute to existing ventures. Stores can be either open, permitting anybody to see and contribute, or private, limiting access to collaborators you indicate.

Exploring GitHub
Stores
Repositories are at the core of GitHub. Each store contains all the files, history, and metadata related to an extent. After you explore a store, you'll ordinarily see:

Code: The area where you'll view, alter, and browse the records within the extend.
Issues: A put to report bugs, recommend highlights or talk about anything related to the venture.
Drag Demands: Proposition for changes submitted by supporters. They permit code surveys and collaboration time recently changes have merged into the most codebase.
Wiki/Documentation: Extra assets to assist clients to get it and contribute to the venture.
Settings: Where you'll oversee store settings, collaborators, and integrative.
Collaborating
GitHub encourages collaboration among designers through different highlights:

Forking: Making an individual duplicate of somebody else's store to form changes without influencing the first.
Branching: Making confined situations to work on particular highlights or fixes without influencing the most codebase.
Drag Demands: Asking for changes from donors and starting code surveys and talks.
Code Survey: Looking into proposed changes, giving criticism, and recommending improvements.
Issues: Announcing bugs, recommending highlights, and talking about thoughts related to the extent.
Form Control
Form control is principal to GitHub's usefulness. Git tracks changes to records over time, permitting engineers to:

Commit: Save changes to the store with a message depicting the alterations made.
Department: Make parallel adaptations of the codebase to work on isolated highlights or fixes.
Combine: Combine changes from one department into another, ordinarily consolidating include branches into the most departments (e.g., ace or fundamental).
Return: Roll back to a past state of the codebase in case essential.
Extend Administration
GitHub gives devices for overseeing and organizing ventures, including:

Ventures: Sheets where you'll be able to organize errands, and issues, and drag demands into columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Advance,""Done").
Breakthroughs: Collections of issues or drag demands that speak to a particular extent or include.
Names: Labels connected to issues and drag demands to classify and prioritize them (e.g., bug, improvement, documentation).
Workflow Mechanization: Utilizing GitHub Activities or third-party integrative to computerize monotonous tasks, such as testing, building, and sending code.
Conclusion
GitHub could be an effective stage for collaboration, version control, and venture administration. By understanding its highlights and best hones, designers can streamline their workflow, cultivate collaboration, and construct superior programs together. Whether you are a prepared engineer or a fair beginning, GitHub gives the apparatuses and framework required to succeed in today's collaborative computer program advancement landscape.
